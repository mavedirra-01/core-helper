Nessus failed to negotiate a TLS connection or get the associated SSL
certificate, perhaps because of a network connectivity problem or the

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature

    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer

    support or does not recognize.

cryptographically weak hashing algorithm (e.g., MD2, MD4, MD5, or SHA1). These signature algorithms are known to be 
vulnerable to collision attacks (CVE-2004-2761, for example). An attacker can exploit this to generate another 
certificate with the same digital signature, allowing the attacker to masquerade as the affected service.

Note that this plugin reports all SSL certificate chains signed with SHA-1 that expire after January 1, 2017 as 
vulnerable. This is in accordance with Google's gradual sunsetting of the SHA-1 cryptographic hash algorithm.

Note that this plugin will only fire on root certificates that are known certificate authorities as listed in Tenable 
Community Knowledge Article 000001752. That is what differentiates this plugin from plugin 35291, which will fire on any
certificate, not just known certificate authority root certificates.

Known certificate authority root certificates are inherently trusted and so any potential issues with the signature, 
including it being signed using a weak hashing algorithm, are not considered security issues.","Contact the Certificate Authority to have the certificate reissued.","http://www.nessus.org/u?ae636e78

            <h3>About Us</h3><br>
            <h5>
              <p>Comanche Nation Gaming Commissioner (CNGC) Mission Statement: CNGC's mission is to maintain the
                integrity
                of all Comanche Nation gaming and ensure that the Nation is the primary beneficiary of Comanche gaming
                by
                protecting the Nations assets. To fulfill the mission and achieve compliance, CNGC works within the
                framework created to perform the delegated duties defined by the Comanche Nation Gaming Ordinance, and
                all
                gaming related regulations, by providing sound guidance and sensibly regulating gaming activities
                conducted by Comanche Nation. </p><br>
              <p>
                CNGC's vision is to utilize all of its regulatory tools, including training, education, and enforcement,
                to promote economic self-sufficiency of the Nation.
              </p><br>
              <p>
                CNGC is responsible for implementing the provisions of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) and of
                the
                most recently approved Comanche Nation Gaming Ordinance (CNGO). The primary responsibility of the gaming
                commission is to oversee, and regulate gaming within the jurisdiction of the Comanche Nation, and to
                ensure fair, and honest gaming activities at all facilities. The CNGC also monitors, and safeguards from
                organized crime, and corruption.
              </p><br>
              <p>
                The CNGC performs a variety of functions in carrying out its responsibilities, such as conducting
                extensive background investigations on vendors and employees. As well as, examining, and approval of all
                electronic games, cards, table games, environmental, public health, and safety audits. The CNGC also
                ensures internal, and external audits are performed reviewing for compliance with applicable standards,
                regulations, and financials, on the gaming facilities.
              </p><br>
              <p>
                Regular reports on the CNGC efforts, to ensure compliance and financial accountability, are provided to
                the National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC), the State Compliance Agency, Office of Management and
                Enterprise Services (OMES) of Oklahoma as part of the Tribal-State Compact, and to the Comanche Nation.
                The gaming commission strives to ensure the Comanche Nation and the Comanche people are the
                beneficiaries
                of the revenues generated at each Comanche gaming facility.</p>

        <h2>Indian Gaming Regulatory Act</h2>
        <h5>Enacted by Congress in 1988, authorized the establishment of the National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC)
          for the purpose of setting standards for, and regulating the conduct of, Indian gaming. In addition, under the
          Act, Congress required that any tribe engaged in gaming must do so only with a tribal ordinance approved by
          the NIGC setting forth the criteria for tribal regulation of such gaming. The Comanche Nation Gaming
          Commissioner (CNGC) currently oversees gaming activity in six (6) gaming facilities. CNE facilities are
          located: one (1) in Lawton; three (3) near Devol; one (1) in Walters; and one (1) in Richard Spur,
          Oklahoma.<br>
          <br>CNGC is the primary regulatory authority over gaming within the jurisdiction of Comanche Nation lands. The
          CNGC assures the general public that gaming conducted on tribal lands is in accordance and under the
          guidelines that are set forth in regulations set by tribal, state, and federal laws. The CNGC is independent
          and provides oversight of gaming operations. The CNGC ensures that gaming is conducted in accordance with laws
          in an effort to protect the assets and integrity of the Nation's gaming operations. In addition, the
          Commissioner ensures the protection of the health and safety of patrons and employees within the gaming
          operations.

vulnerabilities.","The remote web server does not set an X-Frame-Options response header
or a Content-Security-Policy 'frame-ancestors' response header in all
content responses. This could potentially expose the site to a
clickjacking or UI redress attack, in which an attacker can trick a
user into clicking an area of the vulnerable page that is different
than what the user perceives the page to be. This can result in a user
performing fraudulent or malicious transactions.

X-Frame-Options has been proposed by Microsoft as a way to mitigate
clickjacking attacks and is currently supported by all major browser
vendors.

Content-Security-Policy (CSP) has been proposed by the W3C Web
Application Security Working Group, with increasing support among
all major browser vendors, as a way to mitigate clickjacking and other
attacks. The 'frame-ancestors' policy directive restricts which
sources can embed the protected resource.

Note that while the X-Frame-Options and Content-Security-Policy
response headers are not the only mitigations for clickjacking, they
are currently the most reliable methods that can be detected through
automation. Therefore, this plugin may produce false positives if
other mitigation strategies (e.g., frame-busting JavaScript) are
deployed or if the page does not perform any security-sensitive
transactions.","Return the X-Frame-Options or Content-Security-Policy (with the
'frame-ancestors' directive) HTTP header with the page's response.

"95631","","","None","google.ca","tcp","443","SSL Certificate Signed Using Weak Hashing Algorithm (Known CA)","A known CA SSL certificate in the certificate chain has been signed
using a weak hashing algorithm.","The remote service uses a known CA certificate in the SSL certificate chain that has been signed using a 
cryptographically weak hashing algorithm (e.g., MD2, MD4, MD5, or SHA1). These signature algorithms are known to be 
vulnerable to collision attacks (CVE-2004-2761, for example). An attacker can exploit this to generate another 
certificate with the same digital signature, allowing the attacker to masquerade as the affected service.

Note that this plugin reports all SSL certificate chains signed with SHA-1 that expire after January 1, 2017 as 
vulnerable. This is in accordance with Google's gradual sunsetting of the SHA-1 cryptographic hash algorithm.

Note that this plugin will only fire on root certificates that are known certificate authorities as listed in Tenable 
Community Knowledge Article 000001752. That is what differentiates this plugin from plugin 35291, which will fire on any
certificate, not just known certificate authority root certificates.

Known certificate authority root certificates are inherently trusted and so any potential issues with the signature, 
including it being signed using a weak hashing algorithm, are not considered security issues.","Contact the Certificate Authority to have the certificate reissued.","http://www.nessus.org/u?ae636e78

The following known CA certificates were part of the certificate
chain sent by the remote host, but contain hashes that are considered
to be weak.

using a weak hashing algorithm.","The remote service uses a known CA certificate in the SSL certificate chain that has been signed using a 
cryptographically weak hashing algorithm (e.g., MD2, MD4, MD5, or SHA1). These signature algorithms are known to be 
vulnerable to collision attacks (CVE-2004-2761, for example). An attacker can exploit this to generate another 
certificate with the same digital signature, allowing the attacker to masquerade as the affected service.

Note that this plugin reports all SSL certificate chains signed with SHA-1 that expire after January 1, 2017 as 
vulnerable. This is in accordance with Google's gradual sunsetting of the SHA-1 cryptographic hash algorithm.

Note that this plugin will only fire on root certificates that are known certificate authorities as listed in Tenable 
Community Knowledge Article 000001752. That is what differentiates this plugin from plugin 35291, which will fire on any
certificate, not just known certificate authority root certificates.

Known certificate authority root certificates are inherently trusted and so any potential issues with the signature, 
including it being signed using a weak hashing algorithm, are not considered security issues.","Contact the Certificate Authority to have the certificate reissued.","http://www.nessus.org/u?ae636e78
